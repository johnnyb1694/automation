1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?

A: You would type '{}'

2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?

A: {'foo':42} (in general, the pattern {key:value} is obeyed).

3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?

A: A dictionary is unordered. A list, however, is ordered and you can use certain methods based on this (e.g. append() and so forth)

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?

A: You will get a 'keyError' type of error in return.

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?

A: There is no difference.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?

A: The first expression searches for the key equal to 'cat' whereas the second expression searches for the value equal to 'cat'

7. What is a shortcut for the following code?

if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'

A: spam.setdefault('color', 'black') (note that the get() method does not change the list but instead returns a value)

8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?

A: The 'pprint' module and the corresponding 'pprint()' method!
